You do not need to make a Constitution check each round to avoid losing additional hit points. You may choose to act as if you were disabled, rather than dying. You must make this decision as soon as you are reduced to negative hit points (even if it isn't your turn). If you do not choose to act as if you were disabled, you immediately fall unconscious.When using this feat, you are staggered. You can take a  move  action  without  further  injuring  yourself,  but  if you  perform  any  standard  action  (or  any  other  action deemed as strenuous, including some swift actions, such as casting a quickened spell) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act. If your negative hit points are equal  to  or  greater  than  your  Constitution  score,  you immediately die.\r\n\r\nNormal: A character without this feat who is reduced to negative hit points is unconscious and dying.",
